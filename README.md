# ANN-Examples
Some experiments with Neural Networks that can be useful. 
I plan to add some simple examples I use while teaching Neural Networks to my friends and classmates.

# Currently added:
* ELM: A simple example of Extreme Learning Machine, using Numpy.

Feel free to ask for suggestions in order to expand this
